;; ## PuppetDB command handling
;;
;; Commands are the mechanism by which changes are made to PuppetDB's
;; model of a population. Commands are represented by `command
;; objects`, which have the following JSON wire format:
;;
;;     {"command": "...",
;;      "version": 123,
;;      "payload": <json object>}
;;
;; `payload` must be a valid JSON string of any sort. It's up to an
;; individual handler function how to interpret that object.
;;
;; More details can be found in [the spec](../spec/commands.md).
;;
;; The command object may also contain an `annotations` attribute
;; containing a map with arbitrary keys and values which may have
;; command-specific meaning or may be used by the message processing
;; framework itself.
;;
;; Commands should include a `received` annotation containing a
;; timestamp of when the message was first seen by the system. If this
;; is omitted, it will be added when the message is first parsed, but
;; may then be somewhat inaccurate.
;;
;; Commands should include an `id` annotation containing a unique,
;; string identifier for the command. If this is omitted, it will be
;; added when the message is first parsed.
;;
;; Failed messages will have an `attempts` annotation containing an
;; array of maps of the form:
;;
;;     {:timestamp <timestamp>
;;      :error     "some error message"
;;      :trace     <stack trace from :exception>}
;;
;; Each entry corresponds to a single failed attempt at handling the
;; message, containing the error message, stack trace, and timestamp
;; for each failure. PuppetDB may discard messages which have been
;; attempted and failed too many times, or which have experienced
;; fatal errors (including unparseable messages).
;;
;; Failed messages will be stored in files in the "dead letter
;; office", located under the MQ data directory, in
;; `/discarded/<command>`. These files contain the annotated message,
;; along with each exception that occured while trying to handle the
;; message.
;;
;; We currently support the following wire formats for commands:
;;
;; 1. Java Strings
;;
;; 2. UTF-8 encoded byte-array
;;
;; In either case, the command itself, once string-ified, must be a
;; JSON-formatted string with the aforementioned structure.

;;           }
;;        }
;;     }
;;
;; The `"global"` hierarchy contains metrics aggregated across all

;;
;; * `:seen`: the number of commands (valid or not) encountered
;;
;; * `:processeed`: the number of commands successfully processed
;;
;; * `:fatal`: the number of fatal errors

;; ## MQ I/O
;;
;; The data flow through the code is as follows:

;;
;; * The message is fed through a _message processor_: a function that

;;
;; * Repeat ad-infinitum
;;

;; ## MQ processing middleware
;;
;; The parsing and processing of incoming commands is architected as a
;; set of _middleware_ functions. That is, higher-order functions that
;; add capabilities to an existing message-handling
;; function. Middleware can be stacked, creating sophisticated
;; hierarchies of functionality. And because each middleware function
;; is isolated in terms of capability, testability is much simpler.
;;
;; It's not an original idea; it was stolen from _Ring's_ middleware
;; architecture.
