;; ## Schema migrations
;;
;; The `migrate!` function can be used to apply all the pending migrations to
;; the database, in ascending order of schema version. Pending is defined as
;; having a schema version greater than the current version in the database.
;;
;; A migration is specified by defining a function of arity 0 and adding it to
;; the `migrations` map, along with its schema version. To apply the migration,
;; the migration function will be invoked, and the schema version and current
;; time will be recorded in the schema_migrations table.
;;
;; NOTE: in order to support bug-fix schema changes to older branches without
;; breaking the ability to upgrade, it is possible to define a sequence of
;; migrations with non-sequential integers.  e.g., if the 1.0.x branch
;; contains migrations 1-5, and the 2.0.x branch contains schema migrations
;; 1-10, and then a bugfix schema change (such as creating or adding an index)
;; is identified, this migration can be defined as #11 in both branches.  Code
;; in the 1.0.x branch should happily apply #11 even though it does not have
;; a definition for 6-10.  Then when a 1.0.x user upgrades to 2.0.x, migrations
;; 6-10 will be applied, and 11 will be skipped because it's already been run.
;; Because of this, it is crucial to be extremely careful about numbering new
;; migrations if they are going into multiple branches.  It's also crucial to
;; be absolutely certain that the schema change in question is compatible
;; with both branches and that the migrations missing from the earlier branch
;; can reasonably and safely be applied *after* the bugfix migration, because
;; that is what will happen for upgrading users.
;;
;; In short, here are some guidelines re: applying schema changes to multiple
;; branches:
;;
;; 1. If at all possible, avoid it.
;; 2. Seriously, are you sure you need to do this? :)
;; 3. OK, if you really must do it, make sure that the schema change in question
;;    is as independent as humanly possible.  For example, things like creating
;;    or dropping an index on a table should be fairly self-contained.  You should
;;    think long and hard about any change more complex than that.
;; 4. Determine what the latest version of the schema is in each of the two branches.
;; 5. Examine every migration that exists in the newer branch but not the older
;;    branch, and make sure that your new schema change will not conflict with
;;    *any* of those migrations.  Your change must be able to execute successfully
;;    regardless of whether it is applied BEFORE all of those migrations or AFTER
;;    them.
;; 6. If you're certain you've met the conditions described above, choose the next
;;    available integer from the *newer* branch and add your migration to both
;;    branches using this integer.  This will result in a gap between the integers
;;    in the migrations array in the old branch, but that is not a problem.
;;
;; _TODO: consider using multimethods for migration funcs_
