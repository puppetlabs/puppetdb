;; ## SQL query compiler
;;
;; The query compile operates in a multi-step process. Compilation begins with
;; one of the `foo-query->sql` functions. The job of these functions is
;; basically to call `compile-term` on the first term of the query to get back
;; the "compiled" form of the query, and then to turn that into a complete SQL
;; query.
;;
;; The compiled form of a query consists of a map with two keys: `where`
;; and `params`. The `where` key contains SQL for querying that
;; particular predicate, written in such a way as to be suitable for placement
;; after a `WHERE` clause in the database. `params` contains, naturally, the
;; parameters associated with that SQL expression. For instance, a resource
;; query for `["=" ["node" "name"] "foo.example.com"]` will compile to:
;;
;;     {:where "certname_catalogs.certname = ?"
;;      :params ["foo.example.com"]}
;;
;; The `where` key is then inserted into a template query to return
;; the final result as a string of SQL code.
;;
;; The compiled query components can be combined by operators such as `AND` or
;; `OR`, which return the same sort of structure. Operators which accept other
;; terms as their arguments are responsible for compiling their arguments
;; themselves. To facilitate this, those functions accept as their first
;; argument a map from operator to compile function. This allows us to have a
;; different set of operators for resources and facts, or v1 and v2 resource
;; queries, while still sharing the implementation of the operators themselves.
;;
;; Other operators include the subquery operators, `in`, `extract`, and
;; `select-resources` or `select-facts`. The `select-foo` operators implement
;; subqueries, and are simply implemented by calling their corresponding
;; `foo-query->sql` function, which means they return a complete SQL query
;; rather than the compiled query map. The `extract` function knows how to
;; handle that, and is the only place those queries are allowed as arguments.
;; `extract` is used to select a particular column from the subquery. The
;; sibling operator to `extract` is `in`, which checks that the value of
;; a certain column from the table being queried is in the result set returned
;; by `extract`. Composed, these three operators provide a complete subquery
;; facility. For example, consider this fact query:
;;
;;     ["and"
;;      ["=" ["fact" "name"] "ipaddress"]
;;      ["in" "certname"
;;       ["extract" "certname"
;;        ["select-resources" ["and"
;;                             ["=" "type" "Class"]
;;                             ["=" "title" "apache"]]]]]]
;;
;; This will perform a query (via `select-resources`) for resources matching
;; `Class[apache]`. It will then pick out the `certname` from each of those,
;; and match against the `certname` of fact rows, returning those facts which
;; have a corresponding entry in the results of `select-resources` and which
;; are named `ipaddress`. Effectively, the semantics of this query are "find
;; the ipaddress of every node with Class[apache]".
;;
;; The resulting SQL from the `foo-query->sql` functions selects all the
;; columns. Thus consumers of those functions may need to wrap that query with
;; another `SELECT` to pull out only the desired columns. Similarly for
;; applying ordering constraints.
