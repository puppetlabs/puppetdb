;; ## SQL query compiler
;;
;; The query compiler operates in effectively a three-step process. Because the
;; query is compiled depth-first, however, the first two steps may be
;; intermingled.
;;
;; The first step is compilation of = predicates into where clauses, params,
;; and any necessary join tables. The where clauses are formulated such that
;; they can be combined using AND/OR without requiring any extra joins or
;; logic.
;;
;; The second step is compilation of and/or/not predicates. The first two of
;; these are compiled fairly trivially by joining their child WHERE clauses
;; with AND/OR, and concatenating the joins and params lists. "not" predicates
;; are first compiled as an OR predicate, whose WHERE clause is then prepended
;; with NOT.
;;
;; The final step is building the ultimate query which will be executed. This
;; means building JOIN expressions for any necessary tables, and appending the
;; JOINs and WHERE clause to the query which fetches the desired columns.
