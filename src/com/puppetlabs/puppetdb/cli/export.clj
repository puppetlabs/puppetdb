;; ## Export utility
;;
;; This is a command-line tool for exporting data from PuppetDB.  It currently
;; only supports exporting catalog data.
;;
;; The command will produce a tarball that can then be used with the companion
;; `import` PuppetDB command-line tool to import data into another PuppetDB
;; database.
