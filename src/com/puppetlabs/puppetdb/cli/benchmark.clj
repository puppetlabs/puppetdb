;; ## Benchmark suite
;;
;; This command-line utility will simulate catalog submission for a
;; population. It requires that a separate, running instance of
;; PuppetDB for it to submit catalogs to.
;;
;; Aspects of a population this tool currently models:
;;
;; * Number of nodes
;; * Run interval
;; * How often a host's catalog changes
;; * A starting catalog
;;
;; We attempt to approximate a number of hosts submitting catalogs at
;; the specified runinterval with the specified rate-of-churn in
;; catalog content.
;;
;; The list of nodes is modeled in the tool as a set of Clojure
;; agents, with one agent per host. Each agent has the following
;; state:
;;
;;     {:host    ;; the host's name
;;      :lastrun ;; when the host last sent a catalog
;;      :catalog ;; the last catalog sent}
;;
;; When a host needs to submit a new catalog, we determine if the new
;; catalog should be different than the previous one (based on a
;; user-specified threshold) and send the resulting catalog to
;; PuppetDB.
;;
;; ### Main loop
;;
;; The main loop is written in the form of a wall-clock
;; simulator. Each run through the main loop, we send each agent an
;; `update` message with the current wall-clock. Each agent decides
;; independently whether or not to submit a catalog during that clock
;; tick.
