  * `reqs/s`: the rate at which responses of a given status are

  Created metrics are stored in the supplied `storage` atom with the

  `app`: The ring app to be wrapped

  `storage`: An atom that will be used to hold references to all
  created metrics.

  `normalize-uri`: A function that takes a URI, and returns a string
  or collection of strings. For each string returned, a timer and
  meter will be created if they don't already exist. To have multiple
  URLs share the same timer/meter, `normalize-uri` should return some
  of the same strings for each URL.

  Metric names (and thus, the strings returned by `normalize-uri`
  cannot contain ':', '=', or ',' characters. They will be replaced
  with '_'."
