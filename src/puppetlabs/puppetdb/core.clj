   This is a tiny shim that delegates the command-line arguments to an
   appropriate handler.

   If the user executes the program with arguments like so:

       ./this-program foo arg1 arg2 arg3

   ...then we'll look for a namespace called
   `puppetlabs.puppetdb.cli.foo` and invoke its `-main` method with
   `[arg1 arg2 arg3]`."
