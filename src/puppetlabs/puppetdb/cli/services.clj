  "Main entrypoint

   PuppetDB consists of several, cooperating components:

   * Command processing

     PuppetDB uses a CQRS pattern for making changes to its domain
     objects (facts, catalogs, etc). Instead of simply submitting data
     to PuppetDB and having it figure out the intent, the intent
     needs to explicitly be codified as part of the operation. This is
     known as a \"command\" (e.g. \"replace the current facts for node
     X\").

     Commands are processed asynchronously, however we try to do our
     best to ensure that once a command has been accepted, it will
     eventually be executed. Ordering is also preserved. To do this,
     all incoming commands are placed in a message queue which the
     command processing subsystem reads from in FIFO order.

     Refer to `puppetlabs.puppetdb.command` for more details.

   * Message queue

     We use an embedded instance of AciveMQ to handle queueing duties
     for the command processing subsystem. The message queue is
     persistent, and it only allows connections from within the same
     VM.

     Refer to `puppetlabs.puppetdb.mq` for more details.

   * REST interface

     All interaction with PuppetDB is conducted via its REST API. We
     embed an instance of Jetty to handle web server duties. Commands
     that come in via REST are relayed to the message queue. Read-only
     requests are serviced synchronously.

   * Database sweeper

     As catalogs are modified, unused records may accumulate and stale
     data may linger in the database. We periodically sweep the
     database, compacting it and performing regular cleanup so we can
     maintain acceptable performance."
