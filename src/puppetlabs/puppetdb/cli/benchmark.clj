  "Benchmark suite

   This command-line utility will simulate catalog submission for a
   population. It requires that a separate, running instance of
   PuppetDB for it to submit catalogs to.

   Aspects of a population this tool currently models:

   * Number of nodes
   * Run interval
   * How often a host's catalog changes
   * A starting catalog

   We attempt to approximate a number of hosts submitting catalogs at
   the specified runinterval with the specified rate-of-churn in
   catalog content.

   The list of nodes is modeled in the tool as a set of Clojure
   agents, with one agent per host. Each agent has the following
   state:

       {:host    ;; the host's name
        :lastrun ;; when the host last sent a catalog
        :catalog ;; the last catalog sent}

   When a host needs to submit a new catalog, we determine if the new
   catalog should be different than the previous one (based on a
   user-specified threshold) and send the resulting catalog to
   PuppetDB.

   ### Main loop

   The main loop is written in the form of a wall-clock
   simulator. Each run through the main loop, we send each agent an
   `update` message with the current wall-clock. Each agent decides
   independently whether or not to submit a catalog during that clock
   tick."
