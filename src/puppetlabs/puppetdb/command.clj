  "PuppetDB command handling

   Commands are the mechanism by which changes are made to PuppetDB's
   model of a population. Commands are represented by `command
   objects`, which have the following JSON wire format:

       {\"command\": \"...\",
        \"version\": 123,
        \"payload\": <json object>}

   `payload` must be a valid JSON string of any sort. It's up to an
   individual handler function how to interpret that object.

   More details can be found in [the spec](../spec/commands.md).

   Commands should include a `received` field containing a timestamp
   of when the message was first seen by the system. If this is
   omitted, it will be added when the message is first parsed, but may
   then be somewhat inaccurate.

   Commands should include an `id` field containing a unique integer
   identifier for the command. If this is omitted, it will be added
   when the message is first parsed.

   Failed messages will have an `attempts` annotation containing an
   array of maps of the form:

       {:timestamp <timestamp>
        :error     \"some error message\"
        :trace     <stack trace from :exception>}

   Each entry corresponds to a single failed attempt at handling the
   message, containing the error message, stack trace, and timestamp
   for each failure. PuppetDB may discard messages which have been
   attempted and failed too many times, or which have experienced
   fatal errors (including unparseable messages).

   Failed messages will be stored in files in the \"dead letter
   office\", located under the MQ data directory, in
   `/discarded/<command>`. These files contain the annotated message,
   along with each exception that occured while trying to handle the
   message.

   We currently support the following wire formats for commands:

   1. Java Strings

   2. UTF-8 encoded byte-array

   In either case, the command itself, once string-ified, must be a
   JSON-formatted string with the aforementioned structure."

;; ## Performance counters

;; For each command (and globally), add command-processing
;; metrics. The hierarchy of command-processing metrics has the
;; following form:
;;
;;     {"global"
;;        {:seen <meter>
;;         :processed <meter>
;;         :fatal <meter>
;;         :retried <meter>
;;         :awaiting-retry <counter>
;;         :discarded <meter>
;;         :processing-time <timer>
;;         :queue-time <histogram>
;;         :retry-counts <histogram>
;;         :size <histogram>
;;         :ignored <counter>
;;         :concurrent-depth <counter>
;;        }
;;      "command name"
;;        {<version number>
;;           {:seen <meter>

;;            :ignored <counter>
;;           }
;;        }
;;     }
;;
;; The `"global"` hierarchy contains metrics aggregated across all
;; commands.
;;
;; * `:seen`: the number of commands (valid or not) encountered
;; * `:processeed`: the number of commands successfully processed
;; * `:size`: the size of the message as reported by the submitting HTTP
;;            request's Content-Length header.
;; * `:fatal`: the number of fatal errors
;; * `:retried`: the number of commands re-queued for retry
;; * `:awaiting-retry`: the number of commands that are currently
;;                      waiting to be re-inserted into the queue
;; * `:discarded`: the number of commands discarded for exceeding the
;;                 maximum allowable retry count
;; * `:processing-time`: how long it takes to process a command
;; * `:queue-time`: how long the message spent in the queue before processing
;; * `:retry-counts`: histogram containing the number of times
;;                    messages have been retried prior to suceeding
;; * `:invalidated`: commands marked as delete?, caused by a newer command
;;                   was enqueued that will overwrite an existing one in the queue
;; * `:depth`: number of commands currently enqueued
;; * `:concurrent-depth`: number of threads currently waiting to write to the disk
;; * `:ignored`: number of obsolete commands that have been ignored.
