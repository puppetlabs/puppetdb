  "SQL query compiler

   The query compile operates in a multi-step process. Compilation begins with
   one of the `foo-query->sql` functions. The job of these functions is
   basically to call `compile-term` on the first term of the query to get back
   the \"compiled\" form of the query, and then to turn that into a complete SQL
   query.

   The compiled form of a query consists of a map with two keys: `where`
   and `params`. The `where` key contains SQL for querying that
   particular predicate, written in such a way as to be suitable for placement
   after a `WHERE` clause in the database. `params` contains, naturally, the
   parameters associated with that SQL expression. For instance, a resource
   query for `[\"=\" [\"node\" \"name\"] \"foo.example.com\"]` will compile to:

       {:where \"catalogs.certname = ?\"
        :params [\"foo.example.com\"]}

   The `where` key is then inserted into a template query to return
   the final result as a string of SQL code.

   The compiled query components can be combined by operators such as
   `AND` or `OR`, which return the same sort of structure. Operators
   which accept other terms as their arguments are responsible for
   compiling their arguments themselves. To facilitate this, those
   functions accept as their first argument a map from operator to
   compile function. This allows us to have a different set of
   operators for resources and facts, or queries, while still sharing
   the implementation of the operators themselves.

   Other operators include the subquery operators, `in`, `extract`, and
   `select-resources` or `select-facts`. The `select-foo` operators implement
   subqueries, and are simply implemented by calling their corresponding
   `foo-query->sql` function, which means they return a complete SQL query
   rather than the compiled query map. The `extract` function knows how to
   handle that, and is the only place those queries are allowed as arguments.
   `extract` is used to select a particular column from the subquery. The
   sibling operator to `extract` is `in`, which checks that the value of
   a certain column from the table being queried is in the result set returned
   by `extract`. Composed, these three operators provide a complete subquery
   facility. For example, consider this fact query:

       [\"and\"
        [\"=\" [\"fact\" \"name\"] \"ipaddress\"]
        [\"in\" \"certname\"
         [\"extract\" \"certname\"
          [\"select-resources\" [\"and\"
                               [\"=\" \"type\" \"Class\"]
                               [\"=\" \"title\" \"apache\"]]]]]]

   This will perform a query (via `select-resources`) for resources matching
   `Class[apache]`. It will then pick out the `certname` from each of those,
   and match against the `certname` of fact rows, returning those facts which
   have a corresponding entry in the results of `select-resources` and which
   are named `ipaddress`. Effectively, the semantics of this query are \"find
   the ipaddress of every node with Class[apache]\".

   The resulting SQL from the `foo-query->sql` functions selects all the
   columns. Thus consumers of those functions may need to wrap that query with
   another `SELECT` to pull out only the desired columns. Similarly for
   applying ordering constraints."
