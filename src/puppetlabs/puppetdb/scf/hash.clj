  A resource is represented by a map that itself contains maps and
  sets in addition to scalar values. We want two resources with the
  same attributes to be equal for the purpose of deduping, therefore
  we need to make sure that when generating a hash for a resource we
  look at a stably-sorted view of the resource. Thus, we need to sort
  both the resource as a whole as well as any nested collections it
  contains.

  This differs from `catalog-resource-identity-string` in that it
  doesn't consider resource metadata. This function is used to
  determine whether a resource needs to be stored or is already
  present in the database.

  See `resource-identity-hash`. This variant takes specific attribute
  of the resource as parameters, whereas `resource-identity-hash`
  takes a full resource as a parameter. By taking only the minimum
  required parameters, this function becomes amenable to more efficient
  memoization."
