  "Catalog persistence

  Catalogs are persisted in a relational database. Roughly speaking,
  the schema looks like this:

  * resource_parameters are associated 0 to N catalog_resources (they are
  deduped across catalogs). It's possible for a resource_param to exist in the
  database, yet not be associated with a catalog. This is done as a
  performance optimization.

  * edges are associated with a single catalog

  * catalogs are associated with a single certname

  * facts are associated with a single certname

   The standard set of operations on information in the database will
   likely result in dangling resources and catalogs; to clean these
   up, it's important to run `garbage-collect!`."

;; ### Timers for catalog storage
;;
;; * `:replace-catalog`: the time it takes to replace the catalog for

;;
;; * `:new-catalog`: the time it takes to persist a catalog for a
;;    never before seen certname
;;
;; * `:catalog-hash-match`: the time it takes to persist the updates
;;    for a catalog with a matches the previously stored hash
;;
;; * `:catalog-hash-miss`: the time it takes to persist the
;;    differential updates of the previously stored catalog and this one
;;
;; * `:add-resources`: the time it takes to persist just a catalog's
;;   resources
;;
;; * `:add-edges`: the time it takes to persist just a catalog's edges
;;
;; * `:catalog-hash`: the time it takes to compute a catalog's

;; ### Counters for catalog storage
;;
;; * `:updated-catalog`: how many brand new or updated (non-duplicate)
;;    catalogs we've received
