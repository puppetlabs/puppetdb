  "Catalog persistence

  Catalogs are persisted in a relational database. Roughly speaking,
  the schema looks like this:

  * resource_parameters are associated 0 to N catalog_resources (they are
  deduped across catalogs). It's possible for a resource_param to exist in the
  database, yet not be associated with a catalog. This is done as a
  performance optimization.

  * edges are associated with a single catalog

  * catalogs are associated with a single certname

  * facts are associated with a single certname

   The standard set of operations on information in the database will
   likely result in dangling resources and catalogs; to clean these
   up, it's important to run `garbage-collect!`."
