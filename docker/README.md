# [puppetlabs/puppetdb](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb)

The Dockerfile for this image is available in the PuppetDB repository
[here][1].

The PuppetDB container requires a working postgres container or other suitably
configured PostgreSQL database. With that in place, you can run PuppetDB like
so:

    docker run --link postgres:postgres --link puppet:puppet puppet/puppetdb

You can change configuration settings by mounting volumes containing
configuration files or by using this image as a base image. For the defaults,
see the [Dockerfile and supporting folders][2].

For more details about PuppetDB, see the [official documentation][3].

See the [pupperware repository][4] for how to run a full Puppet stack using
Docker Compose.

### What data is collected?
* Version of the puppetdb container.
* Anonymized IP address is used by Google Analytics for Geolocation data, but the IP address is not collected.

### Why does the puppetdb container collect data?
