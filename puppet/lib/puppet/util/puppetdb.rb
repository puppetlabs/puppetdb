# TODO: This module is intended to be mixed-in by subclasses of
# `Puppet::Indirector::REST`.  This is unfortunate because the code is useful
# in other cases as well, but it's hard to use the "right" methods in Puppet
# for making HTTPS requests using the Puppet SSL config / certs outside of the
# indirector.  This has been fixed as of Puppet 3.0, (commit fa32691db3a7c2326118d528144fd1df824c0bb3), and this module
# should probably be refactored once we don't need to support
# versions prior to that.  See additional comments
# below, and see also `Puppet::Util::Puppetdb::ReportHelper` for an example of
# how to work around this limitation for the time being.
