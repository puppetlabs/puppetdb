  # TODO: It seems unfortunate that we have to access puppet_version and
  # report_format directly as instance variables.  I've filed the following
  # ticket / pull req against puppet to expose them via accessors, which
  # seems more consistent and safer for the long-term.  However, for reasons
  # relating to backwards compatibility we won't be able to switch over to
  # the accessors until version 3.x of puppet is our oldest supported version.
  #
  # This was resolved in puppet 3.x via ticket #16139 (puppet pull request #1073).
