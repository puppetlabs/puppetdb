# PuppetDB User-Contributed Content

This directory contains code and other content that has been contributed by
PuppetDB users.  It's a place where we can include items that we know will be
useful to other users, but that we can't yet officially maintain or support.
We hope that you will find it valuable!

Please keep in mind that the contents of this directory may not be exhaustively
tested and could conceivably become out-of-sync with the main production code base.
If you find something that is out of date or has any other issues, or if you have
other content that you think may be useful to the community, we welcome additional
submissions via github pull requests!
