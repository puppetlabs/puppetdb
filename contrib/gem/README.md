# PuppetDB Terminus Gemspec

The files in this directory are intended to provide a starting point for
building a gem package of the puppetdb terminus code.  This will be useful
for cases where puppet is being installed as a gem and would also like to
include puppetdb.

Note that support for installing the puppetdb termini via rubygems relies on
changes to the puppet autoloader that were first introduced in the 3.0 series.
