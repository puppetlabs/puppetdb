Summary
-----


PuppetDB has three main groups of settings:

* The init script's configuration file, which sets the JVM heap size and the location of PuppetDB's main config file
* Logging settings, which go in the [logback.xml](#logging-config) file and can be changed without restarting PuppetDB
* All other settings, which go in PuppetDB's configuration file(s) and take effect after the service is restarted


Init Script Config File
-----

If you installed PuppetDB from packages or used the `rake install` installation method, an init script was created for PuppetDB. This script has its own configuration file, whose location varies by platform and by package:

OS and Package              | File
----------------------------|----------------------------
Redhat-like (open source)   | `/etc/sysconfig/puppetdb`
Redhat-like (PE)            | `/etc/sysconfig/pe-puppetdb`
Debian/Ubuntu (open source) | `/etc/default/puppetdb`
Debian/Ubuntu (PE)          | `/etc/default/pe-puppetdb`

 In this file, you can change the following settings:

- **`JAVA_BIN`** --- The location of the Java binary.
- **`JAVA_ARGS`** --- Command line options for the Java binary, most notably the `-Xmx` (max heap size) flag.
- **`USER`** --- The user PuppetDB should be running as.
- **`INSTALL_DIR`** --- The directory into which PuppetDB is installed.
- **`CONFIG`** --- The location of the PuppetDB config file, which may be a single file or a directory of .ini files.

### Configuring the Java Heap Size

To change the JVM heap size for PuppetDB, edit the [init script config file](#init-script-config-file) by setting a new value for the `-Xmx` flag in the `JAVA_ARGS` variable.

For example, to cap PuppetDB at 192MB of memory:

    JAVA_ARGS="-Xmx192m"

To use 1GB of memory:

    JAVA_ARGS="-Xmx1g"

### Configuring JMX Access

While all JMX metrics are exposed using the `/metrics` namespace, you can also
expose direct JMX access using standard JVM means as documented
[here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html).
This can be done using the `JAVA_ARGS` init script setting, similar to configuring the heap size.

For example, adding the following JVM options will open
up a JMX socket on port 1099:

    JAVA_ARGS="-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=1099"


The logback Logging Config File
-----

Logging is configured with a logback.xml file, whose location is defined with the [`logging-config`](#logging-config) setting. If you change the log settings while PuppetDB is running, it will apply the new settings without requiring a restart.

[See the logback documentation][logback] for more information about logging options.


The PuppetDB Configuration File(s)
-----

PuppetDB is configured using an INI-style config format with several `[sections]`. This is very similar to the format used by Puppet. All of the sections and settings described below belong in the PuppetDB config file(s).

**Whenever you change PuppetDB's configuration settings, you must restart the service for the changes to take effect.**

You can change the location of the main config file in [the init script config file](#init-script-config-file). This location can point to a single configuration file or a directory of .ini files. If you specify a directory (_conf.d_ style), PuppetDB will merge the .ini files in alphabetical order.

If you've installed PuppetDB from a package, by default it will use the _conf.d_ config style. The default config directory is `/etc/puppetlabs/puppetdb/conf.d`.  If you're running from source, you may use the `-c` command-line argument to specify your config file or directory.

An example configuration file:

    [global]
    vardir = /var/lib/puppetdb
    logging-config = /var/lib/puppetdb/logback.xml

    [database]
    classname = org.postgresql.Driver
    subprotocol = postgresql
    subname = //localhost:5432/puppetdb

    [puppetdb]
    certificate-whitelist = /path/to/file/containing/certnames
    disable-update-checking = false

    [jetty]
    port = 8080

### Playing Nice With the PuppetDB Module

If you [installed PuppetDB with the puppetlabs-puppetdb module][module], PuppetDB's settings will be managed by Puppet. Most of the settings you care about can be configured with the module's class parameters; see [the module's documentation](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb) for details.

If you _do_ need to change rare settings that the module doesn't manage, you can do the following:

Create a new class in a new module (something like `site::puppetdb::server::extra`), declare any number of `ini_setting` resources as shown below, set the class to refresh the `puppetdb::server` class, and assign it to your PuppetDB server.

~~~ ruby
    # Site-specific PuppetDB settings. Declare this class on any node that gets the puppetdb::server class.
    class site::puppetdb::server::extra {

      # Restart the PuppetDB service if settings change
      Class[site::puppetdb::server::extra] ~> Class[puppetdb::server]

      # Get PuppetDB confdir
      include puppetdb::params
      $confdir = $puppetdb::params::confdir

      # Set resource defaults
      Ini_setting {
        ensure  => present,
        require => Class['puppetdb::server::validate_db'],
      }

      ini_setting {'puppetdb-catalog-hash-conflict-debugging':
        path    => "${confdir}/global.ini",
        section => 'global',
        setting => 'catalog-hash-conflict-debugging',
        value   => 'true',
      }
    }
~~~

`[global]` Settings
-----


The `[global]` section is used to configure application-wide behavior.

### `vardir`

This defines the parent directory for the MQ's data directory. The
directory must exist and be writable by the PuppetDB user in order for
the application to run.

### `logging-config`

This describes the full path to a [logback.xml](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html) file. Covering all the options available for configuring logback is outside the scope of this document; see the aforementioned link for exhaustive information.

If this setting isn't provided, PuppetDB defaults to logging at INFO level to standard out.

If you installed from packages, PuppetDB will use the logback.xml file in the `/etc/puppetdb/` or `/etc/puppetlabs/puppetdb` directory. Otherwise, you can find an example file in the `ext` directory of the source.

You can edit the logging configuration file while PuppetDB is running, and it will automatically react to changes after a few seconds.

### `update-server`

The URL to query when checking for newer versions; defaults to `http://updates.puppetlabs.com/check-for-updates`.
Overriding this setting may be useful if your PuppetDB server is firewalled and can't make external HTTP requests, in which case you could
configure a proxy server to send requests to the `updates.puppetlabs.com` URL
and override this setting to point to your proxy server.

### `catalog-hash-conflict-debugging`

When this is set to true, debugging information will be written to `<vardir>/debug/catalog-hashes` every time a catalog is received with a hash that is different than the previously received catalog for that host. Note that this should only be enabled when troubleshooting performance related issues with PuppetDB and the database server. This will output many files and could potentially slow down a production PuppetDB instance. See the [Troubleshooting Low Catalog Duplication guide][low_catalog_dupe] for more information on the outputted files and debugging this problem.

`[puppetdb]` Settings
-----

The `[puppetdb]` section is used to configure PuppetDB application-specific behavior.

### `certificate-whitelist`

Optional. This describes the path to a file that contains a list of certificate names, one per line.  Incoming HTTPS requests will have their certificates validated against this list of names and only those with an _exact_ matching entry will be allowed through. (For a puppet master, this compares against the value of the `certname` setting, rather than the `dns_alt_names` setting.)

If not supplied, PuppetDB uses standard HTTPS without any additional authorization. All HTTPS clients must still supply valid, verifiable SSL client certificates.

### `disable-update-checking`

Optional.  Setting this to `true` disables checking for updated versions of PuppetDB.  Defaults to `false`.


`[database]` Settings
-----

The `[database]` section configures PuppetDB's database settings.
PuppetDB can store its data in PostgreSQL or a built-in HSQLDB
database.  Note that HSQLDB support has been [deprecated][#using-hsqldb].

> **FAQ: Why no MySQL or Oracle support?**
>
> MySQL lacks several features that PuppetDB relies on; the most notable is recursive queries. We have no plans to ever support MySQL.
>
> Depending on demand, Oracle support may be forthcoming in a future version of PuppetDB. This hasn't been decided yet.

### Using PostgreSQL

Before using the PostgreSQL backend, you must set up a PostgreSQL server, ensure that it will accept incoming connections, create a user for PuppetDB to use when connecting, and create a database for PuppetDB. Completely configuring PostgreSQL is beyond the scope of this manual, but if you are logged in as root on a running Postgres server, you can create a user and database as follows:

    $ sudo -u postgres sh
    $ createuser -DRSP puppetdb
    $ createdb -E UTF8 -O puppetdb puppetdb
    $ exit

If you are running PostgreSQL you should install the regexp optimized index
extension [`pg_trgm`][pg_trgm]. This may require installing the
`postgresql-contrib` (or equivalent) package, depending on your distribution:

    $ sudo -u postgres sh
    $ psql puppetdb -c 'create extension pg_trgm'
    $ exit

Next you will most likely need to modify the `pg_hba.conf` file to allow for md5 authentication from at least localhost. To locate the file you can either issue a `locate pg_hba.conf` command (if your distribution supports it) or consult your distribution's documentation for the PostgreSQL `confdir`.

The following example `pg_hba.conf` file allows md5 authentication from localhost for both IPv4 and IPv6 connections:

    # TYPE  DATABASE   USER   CIDR-ADDRESS  METHOD
    local   all        all                  md5
    host    all        all    127.0.0.1/32  md5
    host    all        all    ::1/128       md5

Restart PostgreSQL and ensure you can log in by running:

    $ sudo service postgresql restart
    $ psql -h localhost puppetdb puppetdb

To configure PuppetDB to use this database, put the following in the `[database]` section:

    classname = org.postgresql.Driver
    subprotocol = postgresql
    subname = //<HOST>:<PORT>/<DATABASE>
    username = <USERNAME>
    password = <PASSWORD>

Replace `<HOST>` with the DB server's hostname. Replace `<PORT>` with the port on which PostgreSQL is listening. Replace `<DATABASE>` with the name of the database you've created for use with PuppetDB.

#### Using SSL With PostgreSQL

It's possible to use SSL to protect connections to the database. There are several extra steps and considerations when doing so; see the
[PostgreSQL SSL setup page][postgres_ssl] for complete details.

The main difference in the config file is that you must be sure to add `?ssl=true` to the `subname` setting:

    subname = //<HOST>:<PORT>/<DATABASE>?ssl=true

### Using Built-in HSQLDB {#using-hsqldb}

Note that support for HSQLDB has been deprecated and will be removed
in a future release. Please see [this email][hsqldb_deprecation_mail]
to the puppet-users list for further information.

To configure PuppetDB to use HSQLDB, put the following in the
`[database]` section:

    classname = org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
    subprotocol = hsqldb
    subname = file:</PATH/TO/DB>;hsqldb.tx=mvcc;sql.syntax_pgs=true

Replace `</PATH/TO/DB>` with the filesystem location in which you'd like to persist the database.

Do not use the `username` or `password` settings.

### `gc-interval`

This controls how often, in minutes, to compact the database. The compaction process reclaims space and deletes unnecessary rows. If not supplied, the default is every 60 minutes.


### `node-ttl`

Mark as 'expired' nodes that haven't seen any activity (no new catalogs,
facts, or reports) in the specified amount of time. Expired nodes behave the same
as manually-deactivated nodes.

You may specify the time as a string using any of the following suffixes:

    `d`  - days
    `h`  - hours
    `m`  - minutes
    `s`  - seconds
    `ms` - milliseconds

So, e.g., a value of `30d` would set the time-to-live to 30 days, and a value of
`48h` would set the time-to-live to 48 hours.

Nodes will be checked for staleness every `gc-interval` minutes. Manual
deactivation will continue to work as always.

If unset, auto-expiration of nodes is disabled.

### `node-purge-ttl`

Automatically delete nodes that have been _deactivated_ or _expired_ for the
specified amount of time. This will also delete all facts, catalogs and reports
for the node. This ttl may be specified the same way as `node-ttl` above.

If unset, auto-deletion of nodes is disabled.

### `report-ttl`

Automatically delete reports that are older than the specified amount of time.
You may specify the time as a string using any of the suffixes described in the
`node-ttl` section above.

Outdated reports will be deleted during the database garbage collection, which
runs every `gc-interval` minutes.

If unset, the default value is 14 days.

### `classname`

This sets the JDBC class to use. Set this to:

* `org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver` when using the embedded database
* `org.postgresql.Driver` when using PostgreSQL

### `subprotocol`

Set this to:

* `hsqldb` when using the embedded database
* `postgresql` when using PostgreSQL

### `subname`

This describes where to find the database. Set this to:

* `file:</PATH/TO/DB>;hsqldb.tx=mvcc;sql.syntax_pgs=true` when using the embedded database, replacing `</PATH/TO/DB>` with a local filesystem path
* `//<HOST>:<PORT>/<DATABASE>` when using PostgreSQL, replacing `<HOST>` with the DB server's hostname, `<PORT>` with the port on which PostgreSQL is listening, and `<DATABASE>` with the name of the database
    * Append `?ssl=true` to this if your PostgreSQL server is using SSL.

### `username`

This is the username to use when connecting. Only used with PostgreSQL.

### `password`

This is the password to use when connecting. Only used with PostgreSQL.

### `log-slow-statements`

This sets the number of seconds before an SQL query is considered "slow." Slow SQL queries are logged as warnings, to assist in debugging and tuning. Note PuppetDB does not interrupt slow queries; it simply reports them after they complete.

The default value is 10 seconds. A value of 0 will disable logging of slow queries.

### `conn-max-age`

The maximum time (in minutes), for a pooled connection to remain unused before it is closed off.

If not supplied, we default to 60 minutes.

### `conn-keep-alive`

This sets the time (in minutes), for a connection to remain idle before sending a test query to the DB. This is useful to prevent a DB from timing out connections on its end.

If not supplied, we default to 45 minutes.

### `conn-lifetime`

The maximum time (in minutes) a pooled connection should remain open. Any connections older than this setting will be closed off. Connections currently in use will not be affected until they are returned to the pool.

If not supplied, we won't terminate connections based on their age alone.

### `connection-timeout`

The maximum time to wait (in milliseconds) to acquire a connection from the pool of database connections. If not supplied, defaults to 1000.

###`statements-cache-size`

This setting defines how many prepared statements are cached automatically. For a large amount of dynamic queries this number could be increased to increase performance, at the cost of memory consumption and database resources.

If not supplied, we default to 1000.

`[read-database]` Settings
-----

The `[read-database]` section configures PuppetDB's _read-database_ settings, useful when running a PostgreSQL [Hot Standby](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Hot_Standby) cluster.  Currently only configuring a Postgres read-database is supported.  See the Postgres docs [here](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Hot_Standby) for details on configuring the cluster.  The `[read-database]` portion of the configuration is in addition to the `[database]` settings.  If `[read-database]` is specified, `[database]` must also be specified.

To configure PuppetDB to use a read-only database from the cluster, put the following in the `[read-database]` section:

    classname = org.postgresql.Driver
    subprotocol = postgresql
    subname = //<HOST>:<PORT>/<DATABASE>
    username = <USERNAME>
    password = <PASSWORD>

Replace `<HOST>` with the DB server's hostname. Replace `<PORT>` with the port on which PostgreSQL is listening. Replace `<DATABASE>` with the name of the database you've created for use with PuppetDB.

#### Using SSL With PostgreSQL

It's possible to use SSL to protect connections to the database. There are several extra steps and considerations when doing so; see the
[PostgreSQL SSL setup page][postgres_ssl] for complete details.

The main difference in the config file is that you must be sure to add `?ssl=true` to the `subname` setting:

    subname = //<HOST>:<PORT>/<DATABASE>?ssl=true

### `classname`

This sets the JDBC class to use. This should be `org.postgresql.Driver`.

### `subprotocol`

Set this to `postgresql`.

### `subname`

This describes where to find the database. Set this to:

* `//<HOST>:<PORT>/<DATABASE>` when using PostgreSQL, replacing `<HOST>` with the DB server's hostname, `<PORT>` with the port on which PostgreSQL is listening, and `<DATABASE>` with the name of the database
    * Append `?ssl=true` to this if your PostgreSQL server is using SSL.

### `username`

This is the username to use when connecting.

### `password`

This is the password to use when connecting.

### `log-slow-statements`

This sets the number of seconds before an SQL query is considered "slow." Slow SQL queries are logged as warnings, to assist in debugging and tuning. Note PuppetDB does not interrupt slow queries; it simply reports them after they complete.

The default value is 10 seconds. A value of 0 will disable logging of slow queries.

### `conn-max-age`

The maximum time (in minutes), for a pooled connection to remain unused before it is closed off.

If not supplied, we default to 60 minutes.

### `conn-keep-alive`

This sets the time (in minutes), for a connection to remain idle before sending a test query to the DB. This is useful to prevent a DB from timing out connections on its end.

If not supplied, we default to 45 minutes.

### `conn-lifetime`

The maximum time (in minutes) a pooled connection should remain open. Any connections older than this setting will be closed off. Connections currently in use will not be affected until they are returned to the pool.

If not supplied, we won't terminate connections based on their age alone.

### `connection-timeout`

The maximum time to wait (in milliseconds) to acquire a connection from the pool of database connections. If not supplied, defaults to 500.


`[command-processing]` Settings
-----

The `[command-processing]` section configures the command-processing subsystem.

Every change to PuppetDB's data stores arrives via **commands** that are inserted into a message queue (MQ). Command processor threads pull items off of that queue, persisting those changes.

### `threads`

This defines how many command processing threads to use. Each thread can process a single command at a time. [The number of threads can be tuned based on what you see in the performance dashboard.][dashboard]

This setting defaults to half the number of cores in your system.

### `dlo-compression-threshold`

This setting specifies the maximum duration to keep messages in the dead-letter office before archiving them. This process will check for compressible messages on startup and after every `gc-interval`, but will only perform the archive once per `dlo-compression-threshold`. The same format can be used as for the `node-ttl` setting above. If set to 0 seconds, this behavior will be disabled. The default value is 1 day.

### `store-usage`

This setting sets the maximum amount of space in megabytes that PuppetDB's ActiveMQ can use for persistent message storage.

### `temp-usage`

This setting sets the maximum amount of space in megabytes that PuppetDB's ActiveMQ can use for temporary message storage.

### `memory-usage`

This setting sets the maximum amount of memory in megabytes available for
PuppetDB's ActiveMQ Broker.

### `max-frame-size`

This setting sets the maximum frame size for persisted activemq messages
supplied in bytes.  Default value is 209715200 (i.e 200 MB).

`[jetty]` (HTTP) Settings
-----

The `[jetty]` section configures HTTP for PuppetDB.

> **Note:** If you are using Puppet Enterprise and want to enable the PuppetDB dashboard from the PE console, refer to [Changing PuppetDB's Parameters](/pe/latest/maintain_console-db.html#changing-puppetdbs-parameters) for more information. PE users should not edit `jetty.ini`.

### `host`

This sets the IP interface to listen on for _unencrypted_ HTTP traffic. If not supplied, we bind to `localhost`, which will reject connections from anywhere but the PuppetDB server itself. To listen on all available interfaces, use `0.0.0.0`.

To avoid DNS resolution confusion, it is recommended that if you wish to set this to something other than `localhost` an IP address should be used instead of a hostname.

> **Note:** Unencrypted HTTP is the only way to view the [performance dashboard][dashboard], since PuppetDB uses host verification for SSL. However, it can also be used to make any call to PuppetDB's API, including inserting exported resources and retrieving arbitrary data about your Puppet-managed nodes. **If you enable cleartext HTTP, you MUST configure your firewall to protect unverified access to PuppetDB.**

### `port`

This sets what port to use for _unencrypted_ HTTP traffic. If not supplied, we won't listen for unencrypted traffic at all.

### `max-threads`

This sets the maximum number of threads assigned to responding to HTTP and HTTPS requests, effectively changing how many concurrent requests can be made at one time. Defaults to 50.

> **Note:** Due to how our web-server (Jetty 7) behaves, this setting must be higher then the number of CPU's on your system or it will stop processing any HTTP requests.

### `ssl-host`

This sets IP interface to listen on for _encrypted_ HTTPS traffic. If not supplied, we bind to `localhost`. To listen on all available interfaces, use `0.0.0.0`.

To avoid DNS resolution confusion, it is recommended that if you wish to set this to something other than `localhost` an IP address should be used instead of a hostname.

### `ssl-port`

This sets the port to use for _encrypted_ HTTPS traffic. If not supplied, we won't listen for encrypted traffic at all.

### `ssl-cert`

This sets the path to the server certificate PEM file used by the PuppetDB web
service for HTTPS.  During the SSL handshake for a connection, certificates
extracted from this file are presented to the client for the client's use in
validating the server.  This file may contain a single certificate or a chain
of certificates ordered from the end certificate first to the most-root
certificate last.  For example, a certificate chain could contain:

* An end certificate
* An intermediate CA certificate with which the end certificate was issued
* A root CA certificate with which the intermediate CA certificate was issued

In the PEM file, the end certificate should appear first, the intermediate CA
certificate should appear second, and the root CA certificate should appear
last.

If a chain is present, it is not required to be complete.  If a
path has been specified for the `ssl-cert-chain` setting, the server will
construct the cert chain starting with the first certificate found in the
`ssl-cert` PEM and followed by any certificates in the `ssl-cert-chain` PEM.  In
the latter case, any certificates in the `ssl-cert` PEM beyond the first one
would be ignored.

> **Note:** This setting overrides the alternate configuration settings `keystore` and `key-password`.

### `ssl-key`

This sets the path to the private key PEM file that corresponds with the `ssl-cert`, it used by the PuppetDB web service for HTTPS.

> **Note:** This setting overrides the alternate configuration settings `keystore` and `key-password`.

### `ssl-ca-cert`

This sets the path to the CA certificate PEM file used for client authentication. Authorized clients must be signed by the CA that that corresponds to this certificate.

> **Note:** This setting overrides the alternate configuration settings `truststore` and `trust-password`.

### `keystore`

This sets the path to a Java keystore file containing the key and certificate to be used for HTTPS.

### `key-password`

This sets the passphrase to use for unlocking the keystore file.

### `truststore`

This describes the path to a Java keystore file containing the CA certificate(s) for your puppet infrastructure.

### `trust-password`

This sets the passphrase to use for unlocking the truststore file.


### `cipher-suites`

Optional. A comma-separated list of cryptographic ciphers to allow for incoming SSL connections. Valid names are listed in the [official JDK cryptographic providers documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/SunProviders.html#SupportedCipherSuites); you'll need to use the all-caps cipher suite name.

If not supplied, PuppetDB uses the default cipher suites for your local system on JDK versions older than 1.7.0u6. On newer JDK versions, PuppetDB will use only non-DHE cipher suites.

### `ssl-protocols`

Optional. A comma-separated list of protocols to allow for incoming SSL connections. Valid names are listed in the [official JDK cryptographic protocol documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/SunProviders.html#SunJSSEProvider); you'll need to use the names with verbatim capitalization. For example: `TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2`.

If not supplied, PuppetDB uses a default of `TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2`. By default SSLv3 is not included in that list due to known vulnerabilities. Users wanting to use SSLv3 need to specify it in their list explicitly.

### `ssl-crl-path`

Optional. This describes a path to a Certificate Revocation List file. Incoming SSL connections will be rejected if the client certificate matches a revocation entry in the file.

### `ssl-cert-chain`

This sets the path to a PEM with CA certificates for use in presenting a
client with the server's chain of trust.  Certs found in this PEM file are
appended after the first certificate from the `ssl-cert` PEM in the
construction of the certificate chain.  This is an optional setting.  The
certificates in the `ssl-cert-chain` PEM file should be ordered from the
least-root CA certificate first to the most-root CA certificate last.  For
example, a certificate chain could contain:

* An end certificate
* An intermediate CA certificate with which the end certificate was issued
* A root CA certificate with which the intermediate CA certificate was issued

The end certificate should appear in the `ssl-cert` PEM file.  In the
`ssl-cert-chain` PEM file, the intermediate CA certificate should appear
first and the root CA certificate should appear last.

The chain is not required to be complete.

> **Note:** This setting overrides the alternate configuration settings
`keystore` and `key-password`.

### `access-log-config`

Optional. This is a path to an XML file containing configuration information for the `Logback-access` module. If present, a logger will be set up to log
information about any HTTP requests Jetty receives according to the logging configuration,
as long as the XML file pointed to exists and is valid. Information on configuring the
`Logback-access` module is available [here](http://logback.qos.ch/access.html#configuration).

A configuration file may resemble the following:

    <configuration debug="false">
      <appender name="FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender">
        <file>./dev-resources/access.log</file>
          <encoder>
            <pattern>%h %l %u %user %date "%r" %s %b</pattern>
          </encoder>
        </appender>
        <appender-ref ref="FILE" />
    </configuration>

This example configures a `FileAppender` that outputs to a file, `access.log`, in the `dev-resources`
directory. It will log the remote host making the request, the log name, the remote user making
the request, the date/time of the request, the URL and method of the request, the status of
the response, and the size in bytes of the response.

### `graceful-shutdown-timeout`
After receiving a shut down, this is the number of milliseconds the server will wait for in-flight requests to
complete before actually shutting down. New requests will be blocked during this time. Defaults to 30000.

### `request-header-max-size`

This sets the maximum size of an HTTP Request Header. If a header is sent that exceeds this value, Jetty will return an HTTP 413 Error response. This defaults to 8192 bytes, and only needs to be configured if an exceedingly large header is being sent in an HTTP Request.

The `[nrepl]` section configures remote runtime modification.  For more detailed info, see [Debugging with the Remote REPL][repl].

Enabling a remote [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) allows you to manipulate the behavior of PuppetDB at runtime. This should only be done for debugging purposes, and is thus disabled by default. An example configuration stanza:

    [nrepl]
    type = nrepl
    port = 8082
    host = 127.0.0.1

### `enabled`

Set to `true` to enable the REPL. Defaults to false.

### `port`

The port to use for the REPL.

### `host`

Specifies the host or IP address for the repl service to listen on. By default this is `127.0.0.1` only, as this is an insecure channel this is the only recommended setting for production environments. Although this is generally not recommended for production, you can listen on all interfaces, you can specify `0.0.0.0` for example.
