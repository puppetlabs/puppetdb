> **Note:** If you are running Puppet Enterprise 3.0 or later, PuppetDB is already installed as part of PE. You do not need to install it separately.

You can install and configure all of PuppetDB's components and prerequisites (including PuppetDB itself, PostgreSQL, firewall rules on RedHat-like systems, and the
PuppetDB termini for your Puppet master) using [the PuppetDB module][module] from the Puppet Forge.

* If you are **already familiar with Puppet** and have a working Puppet deployment, this is the easiest method for installing PuppetDB. In this guide, we expect that you already know how to assign Puppet classes to nodes.
* If you are **just getting started with Puppet,** you should probably follow the [Installing PuppetDB From Packages guide](./install_from_packages.html) instead.

Step 1: Enable the Puppet Labs Package Repository
-----

If you haven't already, you will need to do **one** of the following:

* [Enable the Puppet Labs package repository](/guides/puppetlabs_package_repositories.html) on your PuppetDB server and puppet master server.
* Grab the PuppetDB and termini packages, and import them into your site's local package repos.

Step 2: Assign Classes to Nodes
-----

Using the normal methods for your site, assign the PuppetDB module's classes to your servers. You have three main options for deploying PuppetDB:

* If you are installing PuppetDB on the same server as your puppet master, assign the `puppetdb`  and `puppetdb::master::config` classes to it.
* If you want to run PuppetDB on its own server with a local PostgreSQL instance, assign the `puppetdb` class to it, and assign the `puppetdb::master::config` class to your puppet master. Make sure to set the class parameters as necessary.
* If you want PuppetDB and PostgreSQL to each run on their own servers, assign the `puppetdb::server` class and the `puppetdb::database::postgresql` classes to different servers, and the `puppetdb::master::config` class to your puppet master. Make sure to set the class parameters as necessary.

Note: by default the module sets up the PuppetDB dashboard to be accessible only via `localhost`.  If you'd like to allow access to the PuppetDB dashboard via an external network interface, you should set the `listen_address` parameter on either of the `puppetdb` or `puppetdb::server` classes.  e.g.:

    class { 'puppetdb':
        listen_address => 'example.foo.com'
    }

These classes automatically configure most aspects of PuppetDB. If you need to set additional settings (to change the `node_ttl`, for example), see [the "Playing Nice With the PuppetDB Module" section][config_with_module] of the "Configuring" page.

For full details on how to use the module, see the [PuppetDB module documentation](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb) on Puppet Forge.  The module also includes some sample manifests in the `tests` directory that demonstrate its basic usage.
