[module]: http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb
[config_with_module]: ./configure.html#playing-nice-with-the-puppetdb-module

> **Note:** If you are running Puppet Enterprise version 3.0 or later, you do
> not need to install PuppetDB, as it is already installed as part of PE.

You can install and configure all of PuppetDB's components and prerequisites
(including PuppetDB itself, PostgreSQL, firewall rules on RedHat-like systems,
and the PuppetDB-termini for your Puppet master) using
[the PuppetDB module][module] from the Puppet Forge.

* If you are **already familiar with Puppet** and have a working Puppet
  deployment, this is the easiest method for installing PuppetDB. In this guide,
  we expect that you already know how to assign Puppet classes to nodes.
* If you are **just getting started with Puppet,** you may find it easier to
  follow our guide to
  [installing PuppetDB from packages](./install_from_packages.html).

Step 1: Enable the Puppet package repository
-----

If you haven't done so already, you will need to do **one** of the following:

* [Enable the Puppet package repository](/guides/puppetlabs_package_repositories.html)
  on your PuppetDB server and Puppet master server.
* Grab the PuppetDB and PuppetDB-termini packages, and import them into your
  site's local package repos.

Step 2: Assign classes to nodes
-----

Using the normal methods for your site, assign the PuppetDB module's classes to
your servers. You have three main options for deploying PuppetDB:

* If you are installing PuppetDB on the same server as your Puppet master,
  assign the `puppetdb` and `puppetdb::master::config` classes to it.
* If you want to run PuppetDB on its own server with a local PostgreSQL
  instance, assign the `puppetdb` class to it, and assign the
  `puppetdb::master::config` class to your Puppet master. Make sure to set the
  class parameters as necessary.
* If you want PuppetDB and PostgreSQL to each run on their own servers, assign
  the `puppetdb::server` class and the `puppetdb::database::postgresql` classes
  to different servers, and the `puppetdb::master::config` class to your Puppet
  master. Make sure to set the class parameters as necessary.

Note: By default, the module sets up the PuppetDB dashboard to be accessible
only via `localhost`. If you'd like to allow access to the PuppetDB dashboard
via an external network interface, set the `listen_address` parameter on either
of the `puppetdb` or `puppetdb::server` classes as follows:

    class { 'puppetdb':
        listen_address => 'example.foo.com'
    }

These classes automatically configure most aspects of PuppetDB. If you need to
adjust additional settings (to change the `node_ttl`, for example), see
[the "Playing nice with the PuppetDB module" section][config_with_module] of the
"Configuring PuppetDB" page.

For full details on how to use the module, see the
[PuppetDB module documentation](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb)
on Puppet Forge. The module also includes some sample manifests in the `tests`
directory that demonstrate its basic usage.
