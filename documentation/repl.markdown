canonical: "/puppetdb/1.1/repl.html"
---

PuppetDB includes a remote REPL interface, which is disabled by default.

This is mostly of use to developers who know Clojure and are familiar with PuppetDB's code base. It allows you to modify PuppetDB's code on the fly. Most users should never need to use the REPL, and it should usually be left disabled for security reasons.

Enabling the REPL
-----

To enable the REPL, you must edit PuppetDB's config file to [enable it, configure the REPL type, and choose a port](./configure.html#repl-settings):

    # /etc/puppetdb/conf.d/repl.ini
    [repl]
    enabled = true
    type = nrepl
    port = 8081

After configuring it, you should restart the PuppetDB service.

Connecting to a Remote REPL
-----

Once PuppetDB is accepting remote REPL connections, you can connect to it and begin issuing low-level debugging commands and Clojure code.

For example, with an _nrepl_ type REPL configured on port 8082:

    $ telnet localhost 8082
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    ;; Clojure 1.3.0
    user=> (+ 1 2 3)
    6

Executing Functions
-----

Within the REPL, you can interactively execute PuppetDB's functions. For example, to manually compact the database:

    user=> (use 'com.puppetlabs.puppetdb.cli.services)
    nil
    user=> (use 'com.puppetlabs.puppetdb.scf.storage)
    nil
    user=> (use 'clojure.java.jdbc)
    nil
    user=> (with-connection (:database configuration)
             (garbage-collect!))
    (0)

Redefining Functions
-----

You can also manipulate the running PuppetDB instance by redefining functions on the fly. Let's say that for debugging purposes, you'd like to log every time a catalog is deleted. You can just redefine the existing `delete-catalog!` function dynamically:

    user=> (ns com.puppetlabs.puppetdb.scf.storage)
    nil
    com.puppetlabs.puppetdb.scf.storage=>
    (def original-delete-catalog! delete-catalog!)
    #'com.puppetlabs.puppetdb.scf.storage/original-delete-catalog!
    com.puppetlabs.puppetdb.scf.storage=>
    (defn delete-catalog!
      [catalog-hash]
      (log/info (str "Deleting catalog " catalog-hash))
      (original-delete-catalog! catalog-hash))
    #'com.puppetlabs.puppetdb.scf.storage/delete-catalog!

Now any time that function is called, you'll see a message logged.

Note that any changes you make to the running system are transient; they don't persist between restarts of the service. If you wish to make longer-lived changes to the code, consider [running PuppetDB directly from source](./install_from_source.html).
