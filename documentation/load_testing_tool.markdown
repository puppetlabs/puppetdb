[export]: ./migrate.html

A basic tool for simulating PuppetDB loads is included with
the standard PuppetDB distribution. **This tool is currently experimental
and is likely to change in future releases**.  

The load testing tool can submit catalogs and/or reports at a defined interval, for a
specified number of nodes. It is also able to vary the submitted
catalogs over time to simulate catalog changes (which can cause a higher
PuppetDB load). The intent of the tool is to get a rough idea about
how the system (and software) will handle load under realistic
conditions. The tool will use catalogs/reports/facts specified by the user,
including those exported from a production/running system, to simulate
real-world conditions. While originally designed as a PuppetDB developer tool, we expect that many users may find it useful. 

Getting data for the tool
-----

The load testing tool does not yet have the ability to generate its own data.
To run simulations, you will need a collection of catalogs, facts
and/or reports. The easiest source of this information is the export tool included with PuppetDB (more information [here][export]). The export will produce a tar.gz file containing facts, catalogs, and reports. 

Unzip the exported data. When unzipped/untared, find the `puppetdb-bak/catalogs`,
`puppetdb-bak/facts` and a `puppetdb-back/reports` directories. One or all of
these directories can be used as input to the load testing tool.

Running the load testing tool
-----

Before running the load testing tool, make sure you have the full path to
your example data. You'll also need a config file (such as
`config.ini`) with the host and port information for the PuppetDB
instance you wish to load test. The config file format is the
same as the one PuppetDB uses, but you only need two entries:

      [jetty]
      host=<host name here>
      port=<port here>

There is currently no script for running the tool, so you'll need a
command like the one below:

    $ /usr/bin/java -cp /opt/puppetlabs/server/apps/puppetdb/puppetdb.jar clojure.main -m puppetlabs.puppetdb.cli.benchmark --config myconfig.ini --catalogs /tmp/puppetdb-bak/catalogs --runinterval 30 --numhosts 1000 --rand-perc 10


### Arguments accepted by the benchmark command

- **`--config / -c`**: path to the INI file that has the host/port configuration for the PuppetDB instance to be tested.
- **`--catalogs / -C`**: directory containing catalogs to use for testing (probably from a previous PuppetDB export).
- **`--reports / -R`**: directory containing reports to use for testing (probably from a previous PuppetDB export).
- **`--facts / -F`**: directory containing facts to use for testing (probably from a previous PuppetDB export).
- **`--archive / -A`**: tarball archive obtained via a PuppetDB export. This option is incompatible with the preceding four.
- **`--runinterval / -i`**: integer indicating the amount of time in minutes between puppet runs for each simulated node. Typical values are 30 or 60. 
- **`--numhosts / -n`**: number of separate hosts that the tool should simulate.
- **`--rand-perc / -r`**: what percentage of catalogs submissions should be changed (this simulates typical catalog changes, such as adding a resource, edge, or something similar). More changes to catalogs will cause a higher load on PuppetDB. A typical change percentage is 10.

>**Note:** If --facts, --catalogs, --reports, and --archive are unspecified, the PuppetDB sample data will be used. This data includes catalogs, facts, and reports.
