## Report interchange format

A report is represented as JSON (this implies UTF-8 encoding). Unless otherwise
noted, `null` is not allowed anywhere in the report.

        "environment": <string>,
        "puppet_version": <string>,
        "report_format": <int>,
        "configuration_version": <string>,
        "start_time": <datetime>,
        "end_time": <datetime>,
        "producer_timestamp": <datetime>,
        "producer": <string>,
        "resources": [<resource>, <resource>, ...],
        "metrics": [<metric>, <metric>, ...],
        "logs": [<log>, <log>, ...],
        "transaction_uuid": <string>,

        "job_id": <string>,
        "cached_catalog_status": <string>,

        "noop": <boolean>,
        "corrective_change": <boolean>,

    }

All keys are mandatory unless otherwise noted, though values that are lists may be empty lists.

#### `certname`

String. The certname the report is associated with.

#### `environment`

String. The environment associated to the node at the time of the report.

#### `puppet_version`

String. The version of Puppet that was run to generate this report.

#### `report_format`

Integer. The version number of the report format that Puppet used to generate
the original report data. This is a constant defined by Puppet.

#### `configuration_version`

String. An identifier that Puppet uses to match a specific catalog for a node
to a specific Puppet run. This value is generated by Puppet.

#### `start_time`

DateTime. The time on the agent at which the Puppet run began; see more details
about the `datetime` format below.

#### `end_time`

DateTime. The time on the agent at which the Puppet run completed; see
more details about the `datetime` format below.

#### `producer_timestamp`

DateTime. The time of catalog submission from the Puppet master to
PuppetDB. This field is currently populated by the Puppet master. See more details
about the `datetime` format below.

#### `producer`

String. The certname of the Puppet master that sent the report to
PuppetDB. This field may be `null`.

#### `transaction_uuid`

String. A string used to match the report to a Puppet run, and when not using
cached catalogs, to its corresponding catalog. This field may be `null`.

#### `catalog_uuid`

String. A string used to identify the report with the catalog that generated
it, when using cached ctalogs. This field may be `null`.

#### `code_id`

String. A string used to match the catalog with the Puppet code that generated
it. For example, a git sha. This field may be `null`.

#### `job_id`

String. A string used to match a report to a Puppet run initiated by the Puppet
Enterprise Orchestrator.

#### `cached_catalog_status`

String. Used to represent whether the Puppet run used a cached catalogs and
whether or not the cached catalog was used due to an error or not. This field
may be `null`.

#### `status`

String. The status of the Puppet run.

#### `noop`

Boolean. Indicates whether the report was resulted from a `noop` Puppet run.

#### `noop_pending`

Boolean. A flag indicating whether the report contained "noop" events. These
may result from use of the `--noop` flag, or from resources tagged with the
`noop` parameter. This field may be `null`.

#### `corrective_change`

Boolean. A flag indicating whether the report contained changes to correct
configuration drift. This field may be `null`.

#### `resources`

Array. An array of objects of the following form:


    {
      "timestamp": <timestamp (from agent) when the resource was managed>,
      "resource_type": <type of resource>,
      "resource_title": <title of resource>,
      "skipped" : <boolean for whether or not the resource was skipped>,
      "events" : [<event>, <event>, ...]
      "file": <manifest file containing resource definition>,
      "line": <line in manifest file on which resource is defined>,
      "containment_path": <containment heirarchy of resource within catalog>
    }

In each `<resource>` object `"events"` is an array of objects of the following form:

    {
      "status": <status of event (`success`, `failure`, `noop`)>,
      "timestamp": <timestamp (from agent) at which event occurred>,
      "property": <property/parameter of resource on which event occurred>,
      "new_value": <new value for resource property>,
      "old_value": <old value of resource property>,
      "message": <description of what happened during event>,
      "corrective_change": <flag indicating whether the event corrected system drift>
    }

#### `metrics`

Array. An array of metric objects (below) or null.

    {
      "category" : <category of metric ("resources", "time", "changes", or "events")>,
      "name" : <name of the metric>,
      "value" : <value of the metric (double precision)>
    }

#### `logs`

Array. An array of log objects (below) or null.

    {
      "file" : <file of resource declaration>,
      "line" : <line of resource declaration>,
      "level" : <log level>,
      "message" : <log message>,
      "source" : <log source>,
      "tags" : [<resource tag>],
      "time" : <log line timestamp>
     }

>**Note: Fields that allow `NULL` values**
>In the resource_event schema above, `containment_path`, `new_value`, `old_value`,
`property`, `file`, `line`, `status`, `corrective_change`, and `message` may all be null.

### Encoding

The entire report is expected to be valid JSON, which implies UTF-8
encoding.

### Data type: `<string>`

A JSON string. By virtue of the report being UTF-8, these must also
be UTF-8.

### Data type: `<integer>`

A JSON integer.

### Data type: `<datetime>`

A JSON string representing a date and time (with time zone), formatted based on
the recommendations in ISO 8601. For example, for a UTC time, the string would
be formatted as `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ`. For non-UTC time, the `Z` may be
replaced with `±hh:mm` to represent the specific timezone.

### Data type: `<resource>`

A JSONObject of the following form:


    {
      "timestamp": <datetime>,
      "resource_type": <type>,
      "resource_title": <title>,
      "skipped" : <boolean>,
      "events" : [<event>, <event>, ...]
      "file": <string>,
      "line": <integer>,
      "containment_path": [<string>, <string>, ...]
    }

All keys are required.

`"resource_type"` is the name of the Puppet resource type that the event occurred on.

`"resource_title"` is the title of the Puppet resource that the event occurred on.

`"timestamp"` is the date/time at which the resource's events occurred.

`"status"` is a string representing the outcome of the event. Possible values are `success`, `failure`, and `noop`.

`"skipped"` is a Boolean representing whether or not the resource was skipped during the
Puppet run; a skipped resource should have an empty list of `"events"`.

`"containment_path"` is a collection of strings where each string is a Puppet type or class that represents the containment hierarchy of the resource within the catalog. This field may be `null`.

`"events"` is a collection of objects where each is a Puppet event corresponding
to the resource. This array may be empty.

`"file"` is the manifest in which the resource is defined. This field may be `null`.

`"line"` is the line number (within `"file"`) where the resource is defined. This field may be `null`.

### Data type: `<event>`

A JSONObject of the following form:


    {
     "property": <string>,
     "timestamp": <datetime>,
     "status": <string>,
     "old_value": <string>,
     "new_value": <string>,
     "message": <string>
    }

All keys are required.

`"timestamp"` is the date/time at which the event occurred.

`"property"` is the name of the property of the resource for which the event occurred.

`"old_value"` is the value that Puppet determined the property to have held prior
to the event.

`"new_value"` is the value that Puppet was instructed to set the property to.

`"message"` is a descriptive message providing extra information about the event.
This should be `null` if `status` is `success`.
