Deactivate node wire format: Version 4
-----

PuppetDB receives deactivate node commands from Puppet masters in the following
wire format.

     {
      "certname": <string>,
      "producer_timestamp": <datetime>
     }

#### `certname`

String. The name of the node for which the catalog was compiled.

#### `producer_timestamp`

DateTime. The time of command submission from the Puppet master to PuppetDB,
according to the clock on the Puppet master.

`producer_timestamp` is optional but *highly* recommended. When provided, it is
used to determine the precedence between this command and other commands that
modify the same node. This field is provided by, and should thus reflect the
clock of, the Puppet master.

When `producer_timestamp` is not provided, the PuppetDB server's local time is
used. If another command is received for a node while a non-timestamped
"deactivate node" command is pending processing, the results are *undefined*.

### Data type: `<string>`

A JSON string. Because the command is UTF-8, these must also be UTF-8.

### Data type: `<datetime>`

A JSON string representing a date and time (with time zone), formatted based on
the recommendations in ISO 8601. For example, for a UTC time, the string would
be formatted as `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ`. For non-UTC time, the `Z` may be
replaced with `Â±hh:mm` to represent the specific timezone.

### Encoding

The command is serialized as JSON, which requires strict UTF-8 encoding.
