Puppet agent nodes submit reports after their runs, and the puppet master forwards these to PuppetDB. Each report includes:

* Some data about the entire run
* Some metadata about the report
* Many _events,_ describing what happened during the run

Once this information is stored in PuppetDB, it can be queried in various ways.

* You can query **data about the run** and **report metadata** by making an HTTP request to the `/reports` endpoint.
* You can query **data about individual events** by making an HTTP request to the [`/events`][event] endpoint.
* You can query **summaries of event data** by making an HTTP request to the [`/event-counts`](./event-counts.html) or [`aggregate-event-counts`](./aggregate-event-counts.html) endpoints.

## `GET /v3/reports`

### URL Parameters

* `query`: Optional. A JSON array of query predicates, in prefix notation (`["<OPERATOR>", "<FIELD>", "<VALUE>"]`). See the sections below for the supported operators and fields. For general info about queries, see [the page on query structure.][query]

    If the `query` parameter is absent, PuppetDB will return all reports.

### Query Operators

See [the Operators page](./operators.html)

### Query Fields

The below fields are allowed as filter criteria and are returned in all responses.

* `certname`: the name of the node that the report was received from.

* `hash`: the id of the report; these ids can be acquired via event queries (see the [`/events`][event] endpoint).

### Response format

The response is a JSON array of report summaries for all reports
that matched the input parameters.  The summaries are sorted by
the completion time of the report, from newest to oldest:

    [
      {
        "end-time": "2012-10-29T18:38:01.000Z",
        "puppet-version": "3.0.1",
        "receive-time": "2012-10-29T18:38:04.238Z",
        "configuration-version": "1351535883",
        "start-time": "2012-10-29T18:38:00.000Z",
        "hash": "bd899b1ee825ec1d2c671fe5541b5c8f4a783472",
        "certname": "foo.local",
        "report-format": 4,
        "transaction-uuid": "030c1717-f175-4644-b048-ac9ea328f221"
        },
      {
        "end-time": "2012-10-26T22:39:32.000Z",
        "puppet-version": "3.0.1",
        "receive-time": "2012-10-26T22:39:35.305Z",
        "configuration-version": "1351291174",
        "start-time": "2012-10-26T22:39:31.000Z",
        "hash": "cd4e5fd8846bac26d15d151664a40e0f2fa600b0",
        "certname": "foo.local",
        "report-format": 4,
        "transaction-uuid": null
        }
    ]

### Example

[You can use `curl`][curl] to query information about reports like so:

    curl -G 'http://localhost:8080/v3/reports' --data-urlencode 'query=["=", "certname", "example.local"]'

## Paging

This query endpoint supports paged results via the common PuppetDB paging
query parameters.  For more information, please see the documentation
on [paging][paging].
