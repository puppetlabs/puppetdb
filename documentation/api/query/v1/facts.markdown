Querying facts occurs via an HTTP request to the
`/facts` REST endpoint.


## Query format

Facts are queried by making a request to a URL in the following form:

The HTTP request must conform to the following format:

* The URL requested is `/facts/<node>`
* A `GET` is used.
* There is an `Accept` header containing `application/json`.

The supplied `<node>` path component indicates the certname for which
facts should be retrieved.

## Response format

Successful responses will be in `application/json`. Errors will be returned as
non-JSON strings.

The result is a JSON object containing two keys, "name" and "facts". The
"facts" entry is itself an object mapping fact names to values:

    {"name": "<node>",
     "facts": {
         "<fact name>": "<fact value>",
         "<fact name>": "<fact value>",
         ...
        }
    }

If no facts are known for the supplied node, an HTTP 404 is returned.

## Example

[Using `curl` from localhost][curl]:

    curl -H "Accept: application/json" 'http://localhost:8080/facts/<node>'

Where `<node>` is the name of the node from which you wish to retrieve facts.

For example:

    curl -X GET -H 'Accept: application/json' http://puppetdb:8080/facts/a.example.com

    {"name": "a.example.com",
      "facts": {
         "operatingsystem": "Debian",
         "ipaddress": "192.168.1.105",
         "uptime_days": "26 days"
      }
    }
