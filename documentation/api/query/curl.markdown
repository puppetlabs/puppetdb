You can use [`curl`][curl] to directly interact with PuppetDB's REST API. This is useful for testing, prototyping, and quickly fetching arbitrary data.

The instructions below are simplified. For full usage details, see [the curl manpage][curl] . For additional examples, please see the docs for the individual REST endpoints:

* [facts][]
* [fact-names][]
* [nodes][]
* [resources][]
* [metrics][]

## Using `curl` From `localhost` (Non-SSL/HTTP)

With its default settings, PuppetDB accepts unsecured HTTP connections at port 8080 on `localhost`. This allows you to SSH into the PuppetDB server and run curl commands without specifying certificate information:

    curl -H "Accept: application/json" 'http://localhost:8080/v2/facts/<node>'
    curl -H "Accept: application/json" 'http://localhost:8080/v2/metrics/mbean/java.lang:type=Memory'

If you have allowed unsecured access to other hosts in order to [monitor the dashboard][dashboard], these hosts can also use plain HTTP curl commands.

## Using `curl` From Remote Hosts (SSL/HTTPS)

To make secured requests from other hosts, you will need to supply the following via the command line:

* Your site's CA certificate (`--cacert`)
* An SSL certificate signed by your site's Puppet CA (`--cert`)
* The private key for that certificate (`--key`)

Any node managed by puppet agent will already have all of these and you can re-use them for contacting PuppetDB. You can also generate a new cert on the CA puppet master with the `puppet cert generate` command. 

> **Note:** If you have turned on [certificate whitelisting][whitelist], you must make sure to authorize the certificate you are using.

    curl -H "Accept: application/json" 'https://<your.puppetdb.server>:8081/v2/facts/<node>' --cacert /etc/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem --cert /etc/puppet/ssl/certs/<node>.pem --key /etc/puppet/ssl/private_keys/<node>.pem

### Locating Puppet Certificate Files

Locate Puppet's `ssldir` as follows:

    $ sudo puppet config print ssldir

Within this directory:

* The CA certificate is found at `certs/ca.pem`
* The corresponding private key is found at `private_keys/<name>.pem`
* Other certificates are found at `certs/<name>.pem`


## Dealing with complex query strings

Many query strings will contain characters like `[` and `]`, which must be URL-encoded. To handle this, you can use `curl`'s `--data-urlencode` option. 

If you do this with an endpoint that accepts `GET` requests, **you must also use the `-G` or `--get` option.** This is because `curl` defaults to `POST` requests when the `--data-urlencode` option is present.

    curl -G -H "Accept: application/json" 'http://localhost:8080/v2/nodes' --data-urlencode 'query=["=", ["node", "active"], true]'
