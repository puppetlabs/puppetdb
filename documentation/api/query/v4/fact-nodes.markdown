You can query fact information with greater power by using the '/fact-nodes' endpoint. This endpoint provides the capability to descend into structured facts and query tree nodes deep within this data by using the concept of paths and values.

Structured fact data is normally represented as a hash, which allows hashes, arrays and real types as its values as you can see in this example:

    {
      "cpus" : {
        "cpu1" : {
          "bogomips": 6000,
        }
      },
      "networking" : {
        "eth0" : {
          "ipaddresses" : [ "1.1.1.5" ],
          "macaddresses" : [ "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:00" ]
        }
      }
    }

With the fact nodes endpoint it allows you to query data at a particular node of the tree using the `path` field, and then either analyze or filter on the `value` of that node.

> **Note:** The v4 API is experimental and may change without notice. For stability, we recommend that you use the v3 API instead.

### `GET /v4/fact-nodes`

This will return all fact nodes matching the given query.

### URL Parameters

* `query`: Optional. A JSON array containing the query in prefix notation (`["<OPERATOR>", "<FIELD>", "<VALUE>"]`). See the sections below for the supported operators and fields. For general info about queries, see [the page on query structure.][query]

    If a query parameter is not provided, all results will be returned.

### Query Operators

See [the Operators page.](./operators.html)

### Query Fields

* `certname` (string): the certname associated with the factset
* `environment` (string): the environment associated with the parent fact
* `name` (string): the name of the parent fact
* `path` (path): the path of traversal to get to this node
* `value` (multi): the value of this node

### Response Format

Successful responses will be in `application/json`. Errors will be returned as
non-JSON string.

The result will be a JSON array with one entry per certname. Each entry is of
the form:

    {
      "certname": <node name>,
      "environment": <node environment>,
      "name": <fact name>,
      "path": <path to tree node>,
      "facts": <value of tree node>
    }

### Examples

[Using `curl` from localhost][curl]:

Get the first mac address for eth0:

    curl -X GET 'http://puppetdb:8080/v4/fact-nodes' --data-urlencode 'query=["=", "path",[ "networking", "eth0", "macaddresses", 0 ]]'

which returns:

    [ {
      "certname" : "node-0",
      "path" : [ "networking", "eth0", "macaddresses", 0 ],
      "name" : "networking",
      "value" : "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:00",
      "environment" : "foo"
    } ]

Get all nodes with values higher then 3:

    curl -X GET 'http://puppetdb:8080/v4/fact-nodes' --data-urlencode 'query=[">", "value", 3]'

which returns:

    [ {
      "certname" : "node-0",
      "path" : [ "load_avg" ],
      "name" : "load_avg",
      "value" : 3.16,
      "environment" : "foo"
    }, {
      "certname" : "node-0",
      "path" : [ "cpus" ],
      "name" : "cpus",
      "value" : 6,
      "environment" : "foo"
    }, {
      "certname" : "node-0",
      "path" : [ "foo", "bar", 1, "foobar" ],
      "value" : 5,
      "environment" : "foo"
    } ]

With the globbing array operator, we can also provide some basic matches against all elements in a map, or all elements in an array. This can be useful to search across all values that might appear in different places of the tree.

This example shows a query that extracts all `macaddresses` for all networking devices:

    curl -G 'http://puppetdb:8080/v4/fact-nodes' --data-urlencode 'query=["*>", "path", ["networking","*","macaddresses","*"]]'

which returns:

    [ {
      "certname" : "node-0",
      "path" : [ "networking", "eth0", "macaddresses", 0 ],
      "name" : "networking",
      "value" : "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:00",
      "environment" : "foo"
    }, {
      "certname" : "node-0",
      "path" : [ "networking", "eth0", "macaddresses", 1 ],
      "name" : "networking",
      "value" : "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:01",
      "environment" : "foo"
    }, {
      "certname" : "node-0",
      "path" : [ "networking", "tun0", "macaddresses", 0 ],
      "value" : "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:02",
      "environment" : "foo"
    } ]

The double asterisk (**) can be used with the path glob operator to define any number of element matches. For example if you wanted to see all fact-nodes with the parent `["networking","eth0"]`, the following query could be used:

    curl -G 'http://puppetdb:8080/v4/fact-nodes' --data-urlencode 'query=["*>", "path", ["networking","eth0","**"]]'

Or you could use the double asterisk match at the beginning, to match against a key that is at the bottom of a path, and you are uncertain of its depth:

    curl -G 'http://puppetdb:8080/v4/fact-nodes' --data-urlencode 'query=["*>", "path", ["**","operatingsystem"]]'

Another operator that provides additional power, is the regexp array operator. This operator works a lot like the glob operator, but allows you to use full regexp to match an element for a path.

The example shows a query that extracts all `macaddresses` for all ethernet devices (that is, devices starting with `eth`):

    curl -G 'http://puppetdb:8080/v4/fact-nodes' --data-urlencode 'query=["~>", "path", ["networking","eth.*","macaddresses",".*"]]'

which returns:

    [ {
      "certname" : "node-0",
      "path" : [ "networking", "eth0", "macaddresses", 1 ],
      "value" : "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:01",
      "environment" : "foo"
    }, {
      "certname" : "node-0",
      "path" : [ "networking", "eth0", "macaddresses", 0 ],
      "value" : "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:00",
      "environment" : "foo"
    } ]

## Paging

This query endpoint supports paged results via the common PuppetDB paging
URL parameters. For more information, please see the documentation
on [paging][paging].
