## Resource statuses

In Puppet Enterprise, PuppetDB stores resource statuses from both unchanged and changed resources
in a Puppet report. This information is surfaced via the [`/reports`][reports]
endpoint in a new `resources` field.

This feature will require additional disk space on your PostgreSQL instance.

For information about the configuration of unchanged resources in reports, see the
[`include_unchanged_resources` section][terminus] of the PuppetDB configuration guide.
