title: "PuppetDB 3.1 Â» Data Anonymization"
layout: default
canonical: "/puppetdb/latest/anonymization.html"
---

There are times when sharing your PuppetDB data is required, however due to the
nature of the data it may contain sensitive items that need to be scrubbed or
anonymized beforehand. For this purpose we have given the export tool the ability
to anonymize the PuppetDB archive before returning the archive.

Using the `export` command
-----

To create an anonymized PuppetDB archive directly all you need it the `puppetdb
export` tool,
[more information here](./migrate.html#exporting-data-from-an-existing-puppetdb-database):

    $ sudo puppetdb export --outfile ./my-puppetdb-export.tar.gz --anonymization moderate

This needs to be run on your PuppetDB instance preferably. See `puppetdb export -h` for more options for remote execution.

How does it work?
-----

The tool itself walks through your entire data set applying different rules to each of the leaf data based on the profile you have chosen. The data structure itself is left intact, while only the data contents are modified. The point here is to maintain the "shape" of the data without exposing the underlying data you may wish to scrub. We do this by always ensuring we replace data consistently, so while a string for example may have been replaced with something random - we make sure that all instances of that original string are replaced with the same random string throughout all your data.

By keeping the shape the data can be anonymized based on your needs but still hold some value to the consumer of your anonymized data.

Anonymization Profiles
-----

Anonymizing all data is often not that useful so we have provided you with a number of different profiles that you can choose from that will provide different levels of anonymization.

The profile itself can be chosen on the command line when the command is run. For example, you can choose the `low` profile as an option like so:

    $ sudo puppetdb export --outfile ./my-puppetdb-anonymized-export.tar.gz --profile low

### Profile: full

The `full` profile will anonymize everything, while keeping the shape of data as previously mentioned. This includes: node names, resource types, resource titles, parameter names, values, any log messages, file names and file lines. The result should be a completely anonymized data set. Report metrics under the `resources` and `events` categories are left intact, as these can be inferred from the rest of the data, but names of metrics under the `time` category are anonymized as resource types.

This is useful if you are really concerned about limiting the data you expose, but provides the least utility for the consumer depending on the activity they are trying to test.

### Profile: moderate

The `moderate` profile attempts to be a bit smarter about what it anonymizes and is the recommended one for most cases. It operates different depending on the data type:

* node name: is anonymized by default always
* resource type name: the core types that are built-in to Puppet are not anonymized, including some common types from the modules: stdlib, postgresql, rabbitmq, puppetdb, apache, mrep, f5, apt, registry, concat and mysql. Any Puppet Enterprise core types names are also preserved. The goal here is to anonymize any custom or unknown resource type names as they may contain confidential information.
* resource titles: all titles are anonymized expect for those belonging to Filebucket, Package, Service and Stage.
* parameter names: are never anonymized
* parameter values: everything is anonymized except for the values for `provider`, `ensure`, `noop`, `loglevel`, `audit` and `schedule`.
* report log messages: are always anonymized
* file names: are always anonymized
* file numbers: are left as they are
* log messages: are always anonymized
* metrics: metric names in the `time` category are anonymized as resource
  types.

### Profile: low

This profile is aimed at hiding security information specifically, but leaving most of the data in its original state. By default most things are not anonymized except for:

* node name: is always anonymized
* parameter values: we specifically anonymize any values and messages for any parameter name containing the strings: password, pwd, secret, key, private. Everything else is left alone.
* log messages: are always anonymized

Verifying your Anonymized Data
-----

While the tool itself tries to achieve the documented level of anonymization, this is your precious data and it is recommended you analyze it first before sharing it with another party to ensure all your requirements are met.

The best way to do this, is to untar the export file, and analyze the contents:

    $ tar -xzf my-puppetdb-anonymized-export.tar.gz
    $ cd puppetdb-bak

Inside this directory there is a directory for each content type: `reports`, `catalogs` and each file inside represents a node (and a report instance for reports). The data is represented as pretty-formatted JSON so you can open these files up yourself and use tools such as `grep` to find any specific information you might have wanted to anonymize.
