## PuppetDB 5.2.9

### New features and improvements

- **Order `facts` and `fact-contents` by value.** The v4 `/facts` endpoint now supports ordering by fact value. For more information, see [Facts][facts]. [PUP-3687](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3687)

### Bug fixes

- PuppetDB database migrations failed due to a bug in the most recent releases of PostgreSQL 9.4.23, 9.5.18, 9.6.14, 10.9, and 11.4. This release does not change migration behavior, but includes changes to PuppetDB's database migration to avoid triggering the issue. See [PostgreSQL bug #15865](https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/15865-17940eacc8f8b081%40postgresql.org) for details about the issue. [PDB-4422](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4422)

- Certnames using unusual characters or that are very long will now be stored properly for catalogs. In previous releases, certnames with special characters, or very long certnames, caused duplicate node entries. [PUP-4390](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4390)

- Resolved a bug  where garbage collection table names were causing a conflict. [PUP-4347](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4347)

- Resolved an bug that was causing PuppetDB to crash when performing older database migrations. [PUP-3840](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3840)

- In previous releases, if the database was inaccessible during startup, PuppetDB could become unkillable. [PUP-4308](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4308)

- PuppetDB now logs the correct error when an attempt to query a remote PuppetDB server for sync fails. Previously, PuppetDB was incorrectly reporting a `FileNotFoundException`.
 [PUP-3592](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3592)

- **Storing catalogs with Unicode Unicode alphanumeric tags.** PuppetDB now successfully stores catalogs with Unicode alphanumeric tags.  [PDB-4326](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4326)

## PuppetDB 5.2.8

### New features

- **New Puppet Query Language (PQL) operators.** You can now use the negative operators `!=` and `!~`. [PDB-3471](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3471)

### Bug fixes

- **Logback integration.** The Logstash dependency was accidentally removed in a previous release. The dependency has been reinstated. [PDB-4277](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4277)

- **Improved** `certname` **handling.** Previously, PuppetDB was unable to process commands that were submitted with a `certname` containing special characters such as `/`, `/`, `:` `_` or `0`, or exceeded 200 UTF-8 bytes if PuppetDB was restarted after the commands were submitted and before they were processed. PuppetDB now handles these commands correctly. [PDB-4257](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4257)

- **Errors when using the** `in` **operator with** `"act_only":true`. Valid PQL queries, which use the `in` operator to compare against an array, that are being converted to AST via the `ast_only` option no longer throw a `NullPointerException`.  [PDB-4232](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4232)

- **Errors when using the** `in` **operator with arrays**. PuppetDB would give an error if you used the `in` operator with an array of fact values or any array that did not have just one element. PuppetDB now accepts an array of fact values unless it finds an actual type mismatch. [PDB-4199](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4199)

## 5.2.7

### Improvements

- **Improved PostgreSQL support.** PuppetDB is now compatible with PostgreSQL version 10 and later. [PDB-3857](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3857)

### Bug Fixes

- **(PE Only) PuppetDB no longer syncs reports that are older than the `report-ttl`, but have not yet been garbage collected.** PuppetDB would sync reports when it performed an initial garbage collection on startup, and then sync reports from its remote, which likely had not performed garbage collection as recently.
[PDB-4158](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4158)
- **PuppetDB skips unnecessary work when ingesting commands.** PuppetDB wasn't pulling `producer-timestamp` out of the incoming query parameters for `submit` command requests. This caused PuppetDB to not have the necessary information to tombstone obsolete commands if multiple `store facts` or `store catalog` commands were submitted for the same `certname` while the earlier commands were still in the queue waiting to be processed.
[PDB-4177](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4177)
- **Improved error handling for invalid or malformed timestamps.** If you passed an invalid or malformed timestamp in a PQL query, PuppetDB treated it as a `null`, giving back an unexpected query result.
[PDB-4015](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4015)
- **PuppetDB no longer causes PostgreSQL to create large amounts of temporary files during garbage collection.** This issue caused PostgreSQL's log to flood if the `log_temp_files` option was set to a small enough value. [PDB-3924](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3924)

### Security

- We've blacklisted the jackson-databind dependency to resolve several security issues. [PDB-4236](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4236)

## 5.2.6

PuppetDB 5.2.6 is a security, new feature, and bug-fix release.

### Security

- Our dependency on trapperkeeper-webserver-jetty9 was upgraded to 2.2.0 to fix CVE-2017-7658. [PDB-4160](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4160)
- Our dependency on jackson-databind was upgraded to 2.9.7 to fix CVE-2018-7489. [RE-11706](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/RE-11706)


### New features

- Added support for fact blacklist regexes. Omits facts whose name completely matched any of the expressions provided. Added a "facts-blacklist-type" database configuration option which defaults to "literal", producing the existing behavior, but can be set to "regex" to indicate that the facts-blacklist items are java patterns. [PDB-3928](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3928) 
- Currently, when building and testing from source, internal Puppet repositories are consulted by default, which may cause the process to take longer than necessary. Until the defaults are changed, the delays can be avoided by setting `PUPPET_SUPPRESS_INTERNAL_LEIN_REPOS=true` in the environment. [PDB-4135](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4135)
- An `upgrade` subcommand has been added that should be useful for cases where you want to upgrade across multiple major versions without skipping major versions (as per the versioning). [PDB-3993](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3993)

### Bug fixes

- Previously http submission with `command_broadcast` enabled returned the last response. As a result, a failure would be shown if the last connection produced a 503 response, even though there was a successful PuppetDB response and the minimum successful responses had been met. This issue does not occur with responses that raised an exception. Because the Puppet `http_pool` does not raise 503 as an exception, this issue can be seen when the PuppetDB is in maintenance mode. This is now fixed and changes the behavior to send the last successful response when the minimum successful submissions have been met. [PDB-4020](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4020)
- The find/fix database connection errors after clj-parent 2.0 dep upgrades has now been fixed. [PDB-3952](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3952)

## 5.2.5

NOTE: This version was not officially released, as additional fixes
came in between the time we tagged this and the time we were going to
publish release artifacts.

## 5.2.4

PuppetDB 5.2.4 is a minor bug-fix release.

-   [All issues resolved in PuppetDB 5.2.4](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/issues/?jql=fixVersion%20%3D%20%27PDB%205.2.4%27)

### Bug fixes

-   In previous versions of PuppetDB (starting with 5.2.0), the `~` operator would match
    the JSON-encoded representation of a fact value rather than the value itself. For
    example, this query would unexpectedly fail to match a fact that started with `file`:

    ```
    ~ ^file
    ```

    However, this query would unexpectedly match the fact:

    ```
    ~ ^"file
    ```

    PuppetDB 5.2.4 resolves this issue by correctly matching regular expresions against
    fact values. ([PDB-3930](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3930))

## 5.2.3

NOTE: This version was not officially released, as additional fixes
came in between the time we tagged this and the time we were going to
publish release artifacts.

## 5.2.2

PuppetDB 5.2.2 is a bug-fix release.

### Bug fixes

-   In previous versions of PuppetDB, passing the `node_state` filter criteria as part of a conjuction operator (`and` and `or`) didn't work. PuppetDB 5.2.2 resolves this issue. ([PDB-3808](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3808))

-   PuppetDB 5.2.2 fixes a regression in previous versions of PuppetDB 5.2.x that caused path queries against structured facts to fail when the path included a regular expression component or an array index. ([PDB-3852](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3852))

-   When the Puppet Enterprise (PE) package inspector is configured, duplicate package data can sometimes be submitted from the `gem` and similar package providers. PuppetDB 5.2.2 removes these duplicates, instead of rejecting the data as in previous versions of PuppetDB. ([PDB-3862](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3862))

## 5.2.1

PuppetDB 5.2.1 is a bug-fix release that improves facts query performance and improves command queue management.

### Bug fixes

-   PuppetDB 5.2.1 significantly improves the performance of facts queries that constrain 'name' to a single value, such as `facts [value, count()] { name = 'osFamily' group by value }`. ([PDB-3838](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3838))

-   If you submitted a malformed message to the command queue in previous versions of PuppetDB, the command queue would grow upon receiving the message but would not reduce in size when the message was discarded. PuppetDB 5.2.1 correctly reduces the command queue size when a malformed message is submitted to the queue. ([PDB-3830](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3830))

## 5.2.0

PuppetDB 5.2.0 is a performance and feature release. Performance improvements are focused primarily on improvements to the storage model for facts.

### Upgrading

Upgrading is expected to be straightforward, but in light of the recent changes to facts storage users might expect some quirks:

-   The initial fact submission for each node post-upgrade triggers a full rewrite of fact data for that node, meaning facts processing might slow down for a short while. This could cause the queue size to increase temporarily for users operating near capacity. This should fix itself after Puppet's runinterval (30 minutes by default) has elapsed.

### Bug fixes

-   In previous versions of PuppetDB, resource types were passed to `Resource#new` in string form. This was problematic because it could result in the load of a Ruby resource type which then is in conflict with genereated Pcore resource type.

    PuppetDB 5.2.0 ensures that the indirection uses the same logic as Puppet when creating new resources.

### New features

-   PuppetDB 5.2.0 replaces the existing facts storage schema with a new one based on JSONB. This change doesn't result in any breaking API changes.

    This improvement provides multiple benefits and some incidental new features:

    -   Greatly improved garbage collection performance when large structured facts are updated.
    -   Improved performance of conjunction queries, such as where users request a list of hosts with facts meeting multiple criteria.
    -   Makes future development on facts querying more amenable to the type of descendence queries currently possible with the inventory endpoint.

-   This version of PuppetDB prevents the query engine from limiting queries against the v4 endpoint to active nodes, in cases where the relevant entity has no certname field. This facilitates PQL queries against fact_paths and environments.

-   When using the benchmark tool in PuppetDB 5.2.0, every host is enqueued once before starting the simulation loop.

-   PuppetDB 5.2.0 tracks how long a migration takes and logs them to improve testing and support awareness.

-   This version of PuppetDB adds support for equality conditions on arrays in PQL.

### Improvements

-   If PuppetDB is out of sync, the two most important datasets to reconcile are catalogs and facts, because catalogs are used for exported resource queries and facts are used to select groups of nodes for orchestration operations.

    However, previous versions of PuppetDB started a sync by transferring reports, which can be a significantly large dataset if two instances are out of sync by several days. This would delay reconciliation of catalogs and facts.

    PuppetDB 5.2.0 reorders the sync configuration so that entities are synced in the following order:

    -   catalogs
    -   facts
    -   reports
    -   nodes

    Catalogs and reports have switched priorities, and catalogs are now the highest priority.

-   PuppetDB 5.2.0 improves a query used to target packages for deletion.

-   This version of PuppetDB adds optimization for event queries with the `latest_report?` parameter.

-   PuppetDB 5.2.0 adds the latest report's `job_id` to the nodes endpoint. The `job_id` isn't present if the run wasn't part of a job.
