## PuppetDB 6.6.0

### New features and improvements

### Bug fixes

- A change in the `puppetdb-termini` package for 6.5.0 broke SSL connections that
  did not use Puppet's CA. This fix adds [the `verify_client_connection` configuration option][puppet_apply].
  By default, `verify_client_connection` only allows SSL connections authenticated by the
  Puppet CA. When set to `false`, it allows the use of other SSL connections. [PDB-4487](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4487)

- Fixed an issue where package upgrades on CentOS 6 would sometimes fail when
  upgrading from older versions of PuppetDB (for example, 5.2) to more recent versions
  (for example, 6.3+). [PDB-4373](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4373)

## PuppetDB 6.5.0

### New features and improvements

- **New experimental `catalog-input-contents` endpoint.** Use the [`catalog-input-contents`](./api/query/v4/catalog_input_contents.markdown) endpoint to query for the most recent
catalog inputs that PuppetDB has received for any nodes. ([PDB-4371](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4371)

- **Submit `inputs` to a catalog.** PuppetDB can now optionally store "inputs", such as Hiera keys, during catalog compilation. See the [command's wire format](puppet.com/docs/puppetdb/latest/api/wire_format/catalog_inputs_format_v1.md) for more information on how to submit them. [PDB-4372](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4372)

### Bug fixes

 - We've updated the default auto-vacuum settings for several tables which PuppetDB was vacuuming more frequently than neccessary. These changes will apply once at the next upgrade. [PDB-3745](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3745)

## PuppetDB 6.4.0

### Bug fixes

- This bug affects Puppet Enterprise (PE) only. After a restart or downtime, PuppetDB did not sync its package inventory, resulting in PuppetDB nodes with desynced fact hashes. [PDB-4266](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-4266)
